# MDL Library: Advanced Approaches for Minimum Description Length

Welcome to the **MDL Library**, a collection of advanced approaches for working with Minimum Description Length (MDL). This library provides various methodologies to efficiently model, compress, and analyze data through the MDL principle, offering flexible options for different use cases in data science and machine learning.

## Library Structure

This library includes multiple approaches, each addressing specific challenges in MDL-based modeling. The documentation is structured as follows:

- **[Online Coding](online.md)**: 
- **[Variational Coding](variational.md)**:
- **[Latent Variable Probing](latent_var.md)**: 
- **[Bayesian approach](bayes.md)**: 

All models we use in training inherit from the BaseModel
## Class: `BaseModel`

{{ problib.base.BaseModel }}




Each method page provides:
- **Theoretical Background**: An accessible overview of the theory behind the approach.
- **Usage Example**: Code snippets to demonstrate how to apply the method effectively.
- **References**: Links to relevant research papers for further reading.

Dive into any approach to learn more, explore theory, and see practical examples.
